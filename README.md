# Single File Tools (SFT)

This repository collects a couple of simple utilities written in different
languages for varying use cases. The single common factor is an implementation
comprising just one file. These single file tools are usually written in an
interpreted (or scripting) language.

## The Tools

Some of the single file tools have been published already using a dedicated
web page. In that case a link to the web page is provided.
