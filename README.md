# Single File Tools (SFT)

This repository collects a couple of simple utilities written in different
languages for varying use cases. The single common factor is an implementation
comprising just one file. These single file tools are usually written in an
interpreted (or scripting) language.

is published under a free software license. Additionally, this collection
